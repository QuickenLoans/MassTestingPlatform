Mass Testing Platform is a scheduling, logistics and data orchestration application that was designed in collaboration between Rocket Mortgage, Rock Connections, and the City of Detroit to facilitate drive-through testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Visit the Mass Testing Platform [GitHub Page](https://github.com/QuickenLoans/MassTestingPlatform) or download the [source code](https://github.com/QuickenLoans/MassTestingPlatform/archive/master.zip) directly.**

The documentation on this site will give you a high-level overview of the drive-through testing process, from end-to-end. Please note, this process was designed around the regulations in effect in Detroit, Michigan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, you may need to make adjustments to the process and technology to meet the current regulations in your area.

Documentation on this site consists of:

- [Platform Runbook](./mtp-runbook) to help you understand the end-to-end process
- [Scheduling Administration](./scheduling-runbook) to help you set up your scheduling technology
- [Test Site Logistics](./testing-runbook) to walk you through the logistics of setting up and running a testing location
- [Data Orchestration](./data-runbook) to help you distribute the patient and scheduling data to everyone who needs it

This project wouldn't have been possible without the contributions of [these individuals](./contributors).
